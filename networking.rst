Singularity 3.0 introduces full integration with 
`CNI <https://github.com/containernetworking/cni>`_, and several new features to
make network virtualization easy and convenient.  

Several new options have been added to the action commands (``exec``, ``run``, 
and ``shell``) to facilitate these features.
